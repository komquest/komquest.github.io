# Cheat Sheets for Virus and Web Proxy Detection
--> Alot of common knowledge, but they contain common virus locations on Windows and things to look for in your web traffic

key points:
1. Common Virus locations in Windows
2. Url with IP in it is suspicious
3. If there are ever any "POST"s without a corresponding "GET", that is suspicious

We can model Sysmon events and find that almost **all its events can be correlated by the ProcessGUID field.**

**Sysmon and Windows Event Log, Information Sheet**

** Data Quality**
 --> if data was water, data quality ensures water is clean and does not get contaminated.

A **Data Dictionary** is a collection of names, definitions, and attributes about data elements that are being used or captured in a database, information system, or part of a research project.

Basically it is a frame for data (think meta) that is standard for every event. Look into **YAML**, since this standard can be used across multiple programming languages.

# Mordor

https://github.com/OTRF/mordor

--> The Mordor project provides pre-recorded security events generated by simulated adversarial techniques in the form of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files for easy consumption.

**Conclusion**

I will not use morder or this playbook since it focuses on Apache Kafka and the ELK stack, however, it does have some good buzz words to remember and provides a path and description on how to use Jupyter for analysis.
