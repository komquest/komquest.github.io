# BBOT

BBOT (Bighuge BLS OSINT Tool) is a modular, recursive OSINT framework that can execute the entire OSINT workflow in a single command.

BBOT is inspired by Spiderfoot but takes it to the next level with features like multi-target scans, lightning-fast asyncio performance, and NLP-powered subdomain mutations. It offers a wide range of functionality, including subdomain enumeration, port scanning, web screenshots, vulnerability scanning, and much more.

- Basically this uses osint to find subdomains, vulns, etc of online web apps
